# DLMER-Bio
DLMER-Bio is a R package for deep learning model evalution. Currently, we can calculate example-based precision, recall, average precision, average recall, exact match, S-measure, F1-measure, . We want to use our package for handling multi-labeled biomedical big-data. We are still working on this project, the version now is 0.1.


Source Repository
-----------------
DLMER-Bio's source-code repository is hosted here on GitHub.

Running the Test
-----------------
* For testing, go to main.R, revise the first line: setwd('G:/source_tracking/evaluation'). change the path to the your data path.
* execute source('evaluate.R') then execute source('main.R')

Test Result
-----------------
Average Precision:  0.530492 
Average Recall:  0.5339005 
exact match:  0.484692 
F1 measure:  0.5321908 
S-measure:  1.796419
